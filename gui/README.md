# Initial GUI Plan
- The initial idea was to have a GUI for the user to easily interact with OpenAI and change the number of hunter/prey, type of algorithm, and even the environment.
- The script runs with Python3
- Due to the difficulty of running OpenAI's environments and attempting to build our own custom environments, the GUI was abandoned and never tied with the OpenAI engine.
- This is now obsolete
